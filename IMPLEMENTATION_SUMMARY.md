# Implementation Roadmap - Upcoming Work

## ðŸŽ¯ High Priority Features

### 1. Interactive Dashboard - Work Management
**Goal**: Transform static dashboard into fully interactive project management system

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Add Work Feature**: Allow users to create new work items directly from dashboard
- [ ] **Work Block Definition**: 
  - Define work type (DIY, Contractor, Hybrid)
  - Set budget and timeline
  - Assign to renovation phases
- [ ] **Substeps Management**:
  - Break down work into actionable substeps
  - Track progress per substep
  - Dependencies between substeps
- [ ] **Todo Integration**:
  - Create todos within each work block
  - Assignable checklists
  - Progress tracking
- [ ] **Work Activation Flow**:
  - Move works from "planned" to "active"
  - Status transitions and validations
  - Timeline adjustments

**Technical Requirements**:
- Strapi content types for works, substeps, todos
- Vue components for work management UI
- State management for complex interactions
- Drag-and-drop for work prioritization

### 2. First Use Flow Implementation
**Goal**: Guide new users through initial setup following user journey design

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Onboarding Wizard**:
  - Welcome screen with value proposition
  - Account creation with Belgian address
  - Project type selection (house, apartment, etc.)
- [ ] **Module 1: Getting Started & Feasibility**:
  - Property address validation
  - Quick project scope selector
  - Budget range slider
  - Timeline preference selector
- [ ] **Quick 3D Model Creation**:
  - Guided room-by-room builder
  - Pre-filled Belgian house templates
  - Skip options for quick start
- [ ] **Feasibility Check Results**:
  - Permit requirements display
  - Rough cost estimates
  - Go/No-Go decision screen
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure**:
  - Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
  - Skip options for experienced users
  - Save progress and resume later

**Technical Requirements**:
- Multi-step form with validation
- Progress persistence in localStorage/Strapi
- Conditional routing based on user choices
- Integration with Belgian permit APIs

### 3. Complete Strapi Integration
**Goal**: Remove all mock data and connect everything to Strapi backend

**Current Mock Data to Replace**:
- [ ] **User Profile Data**:
  - Currently: Hardcoded user info
  - Target: Full Strapi user authentication
- [ ] **Project Data**:
  - Currently: Some mock project structures
  - Target: All projects from Strapi
- [ ] **Work Items**:
  - Currently: Static work examples in dashboard
  - Target: Dynamic work items from database
- [ ] **Financial Data**:
  - Currently: Hardcoded budgets and costs
  - Target: User-specific financial tracking
- [ ] **3D Model Data**:
  - Currently: Mixed mock/Strapi
  - Target: Full Strapi persistence

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create missing Strapi content types
2. Build API endpoints for CRUD operations
3. Replace mock data imports with API calls
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Implement data caching strategy
6. Add offline support considerations

### 4. Advanced 3D Builder Features
**Goal**: Extend 3D capabilities for more realistic modeling

**New Features**:
- [ ] **Complex Roof Types**:
  - Gable roofs (most common in Belgium)
  - Hip roofs
  - Mansard roofs
  - Flat roofs with proper drainage
  - Dormer windows
- [ ] **Advanced Shapes**:
  - L-shaped houses
  - T-shaped layouts
  - Extensions and annexes
  - Bay windows
  - Balconies and terraces
- [ ] **Architectural Elements**:
  - Chimneys
  - Skylights
  - Solar panels placement
  - Garage integration
  - Garden sheds
- [ ] **Interior Elements** (Phase 2):
  - Stairs between floors
  - Interior walls
  - Kitchen/bathroom layouts
  - Heating system visualization
- [ ] **Visual Enhancements**:
  - Texture options for walls
  - Material selection (brick, stone, render)
  - Color customization
  - Shadow and lighting improvements

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend Three.js geometry functions
- Create reusable 3D components
- Implement CSG operations for complex shapes
- Add physics for realistic constraints
- Performance optimization for complex models
