## API Integration

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```env
# Frontend (.env)
STRAPI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1337

# Strapi Backend (.env)
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=<generated>
API_TOKEN_SALT=<generated>
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=<generated>
JWT_SECRET=<generated>
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: `/api/auth/local/register`
   - Creates user with `userPhase: "onboarding"`
   - Returns JWT token
   - Redirects to `/onboarding`

2. **Login**: `/api/auth/local`
   - Validates credentials
   - Returns JWT + user data
   - Redirects based on userPhase:
     - `onboarding` â†’ `/onboarding`
     - `project-setup` â†’ `/builder`
     - `active` â†’ `/dashboard`

3. **Token Storage**: localStorage (`auth_token`, `user_data`)

### Main API Endpoints

#### Projects
- `GET /api/projects` - List user projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id?populate=deep` - Get project with relations
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project

#### Buildings & Floors
- Automatically managed through project relations
- Deep population returns full structure

## 3D Builder System

### Core Components

#### Rendering Engine (`components/renderings/house.vue`)
- Three.js scene setup
- Camera controls (OrbitControls)
- Element selection system
- Real-time updates

#### Geometry Generation
- **Floors**: Box geometry with configurable dimensions
- **Windows/Doors**: Cut-out system with box geometries
- **Roof**: Custom geometry functions (gable, hip, flat, shed)

#### Positioning System
```javascript
// Convert 2D floor plan to 3D coordinates
calcOffsetPosition(orientation, x, width, depth)

// Calculate 3D dimensions based on orientation
calcOffsetSize(orientation, elementWidth, elementHeight, wallThickness)
```

### Element Creation Flow
1. User selects tool (window/door/floor)
2. Clicks on 3D surface
3. Element positioned based on raycasting
4. Properties panel opens for customization
5. Element saved to project data

## User Journey

### Phase 1: Onboarding
- User registration/login
- Profile completion (name, phone)
- Project type selection
- Basic property information

### Phase 2: Project Setup (Builder)
- 3D house modeling
- Add floors, windows, doors
- Configure roof type
- Save project structure

### Phase 3: Active Dashboard
- View project overview
- Manage renovation works
- Track progress
- Communicate with contractors (future)

- User authentication (register/login) with JWT
- Multi-step onboarding flow with user phases
- 3D house builder with:
  - Multiple floors with individual properties
  - Windows & doors placement via click-to-place
  - Roof types (gable, hip, flat, shed) with custom geometry

  - Todo system with progress tracking
  - Budget and cost tracking
  - Timeline planning (quarterly + custom)
  - Execution types (DIY, Contractor, Hybrid)
- Basic dashboard with project overview

### Current Focus ðŸŽ¯
**Dashboard Completion** (Primary Priority)
- Enhancing renovation works management interface
- Improving project overview and statistics
- Refining user experience flows
- Preparing for design phase transition

**Next Phase**: Figma Design Integration
- UI/UX design in Figma
- Design-to-code implementation
- Enhanced visual design while maintaining current functionality

### In Progress ðŸš§
- Dashboard refinements and user experience improvements
- Strapi content type optimizations
- Data flow improvements between frontend and backend

### Planned ðŸ“‹
**Phase 1 (Post-Dashboard):**
- Enhanced 3D modeling with standardized shapes
- Improved geometry and positioning systems
- Better performance optimization

**Phase 2 (Core Platform):**
- Contractor matching system (bidirectional search)
- Direct communication between users and contractors
- Offer management system
- Review and rating system

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
- Document management and file uploads
- Cost estimation database integration
- Payment/invoice processing
- Multi-language support (Dutch/French)
- Mobile responsive optimization

**Future Considerations:**
- Native mobile app
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with building material suppliers
- Permit tracking and regulatory compliance

## Business Model & Strategy

### Contractor Matching System
**Bidirectional Search Platform:**
- **Users** can search contractors based on:
  - Geographic proximity
  - Specialization/skills
  - Reviews and ratings
  - Availability
  - Price range
- **Contractors** can search for jobs based on:
  - Location preferences
  - Project types
  - Budget ranges
  - Timeline requirements

**Interaction Flow:**
1. Users post renovation projects (open jobs)
2. Contractors can submit offers on open jobs
3. Users review offers and decide to accept/decline
4. Direct communication channel opens upon acceptance
5. Transparent review system for both parties

**Quality Control:**
- Review system ensures bad contractors fade from platform
- Builds industry-wide quality improvement
- Transparent feedback system

### Monetization Strategy (TBD)
**User Tiers:**
- **Freemium/Premium Model**: Basic features free, premium features paid
- Potential full freemium approach depending on contractor revenue

**Contractor Revenue:**
- **Commission-based**: Percentage of completed projects, OR
- **Subscription Model**: Monthly/yearly contractor memberships
- Final model depends on contractor preferences and revenue forecasts

### Regional Strategy
**Phase 1**: Focus on **Flanders** (Flemish-speaking Belgium)
**Phase 2**: Expansion to **Wallonia** (French-speaking Belgium)  
**Phase 3**: Other European regions

**Implementation Notes:**
- Code already includes regional differentiation structure
- Building standards compliance varies by region
- Language localization planned (Dutch/French)

## Technical Specifications

### Infrastructure & Deployment
**Database Strategy:**
- **Development**: PostgreSQL (user's preferred choice)
- **Production**: PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean
- Note: User typically uses PostgreSQL consistently

**Deployment Platform:**
- **Preferred**: DigitalOcean for both frontend and backend
- Alternative consideration for frontend-only on Vercel
- Full-stack DigitalOcean deployment for unified management

**Current 3D Limitations:**
- Only rectangular shapes currently supported
- System considered "too abstract" for production use
- **Planned**: Standardized shapes with editable base sizings
- Future: More sophisticated 3D modeling capabilities

### Payment Strategy (TBD)
**Options Under Consideration:**
- Traditional payment gateways (Stripe, Mollie)
- **Invoice-based system**: Potentially preferred for B2B contractor payments
- Decision pending based on user feedback and regional preferences

### Testing Framework
**Recommended Approach:**
- **Vitest**: Modern, fast, Nuxt 3 native integration
- **Cypress**: Visual E2E testing (crucial for 3D interactions)
- **ESLint**: Relaxed rules to avoid development conflicts
- User admits to limited testing expertise - framework choice optimized for ease of use

### Browser & Performance
**Browser Support:**
- Modern browsers with WebGL support required
- Current 3D implementation needs performance optimization
- Target: Desktop-first, mobile responsive planned

**Performance Goals:**
- 3D rendering optimization priority
- Bundle size reduction planned
- Progressive loading for complex models

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composables for shared logic
- Prefer Tailwind classes over custom CSS

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches from `main`
- Descriptive commit messages
- PR reviews before merging
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before display
- Implement proper CORS settings
- Use HTTPS in production

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **3D Performance**: Complex models may lag on older devices
2. **Browser Support**: WebGL required for 3D visualization
3. **Offline Mode**: Currently requires internet connection
4. **Mobile Experience**: 3D builder optimized for desktop
